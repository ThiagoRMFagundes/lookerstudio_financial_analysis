# Financial Analysis Dashboard - LookerStudio

In this repository, I share a CSV file with fictional data about bakery sales and the code that generated it. This data was used to create a dashboard in the free tool Looker Studio.

## Context 
As the owner of a bakery, it's crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the financial health and performance of the business. I created a dashboard to gain deeper insights into the sales and profitability.

Here are the key aspects I focus on:
* Quickly assessing revenue, costs, profit, and margin.
* Analyzing financial performance over time and against the same period from the previous year.
* Breaking down financial data by product and category to understand detailed revenue, cost, profit, and margin.
* Identifying which products contribute most to revenue to prioritize focus areas.
* Viewing all relevant information for each product, with a particular focus on identifying products with a margin below 40%.
